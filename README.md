# cadet cleaners

single page web app for Cadet Cleaners, a dry cleaners serving the Dallas, TX area.

clean + mobile first approach. nothing too fancy, just a simple-ish website for potenital/current clients. using angular 2 (then, now 7) was overkill, but i figured this project would be a good excuse to get my feet wet.

**technologies**: angular 7, typescript, bootstrap, s3, angular-google-maps, travis ci.
